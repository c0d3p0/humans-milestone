# humans-milestone
A Survival Horror game developed using the Godot Engine 3.4 and C#.
<br/><br/>

The game is about humans being used as samples in an experiment made by a more advanced and unknown civilization. They want to find out how intelligent humans are, exposing humans to a very stressful experiment where the sample must solve puzzles while avoiding getting caught by a weird creature. Some data is collected and analyzed by this unknown civilization to come to a conclusion about how intelligent that sample is.

Version 1.3 changes:

  - Minor changes to the code to be compatible with Godot 3.4.
  - Added a new Puzzle, Crazy Operation v2 (Crazy Operation v1 wasn't even being used).
  - Increased the light a little bit.
  - Godot 3.4 itself brings a good performance improvement, game runs better now.
  - Minor changes and fixes.
