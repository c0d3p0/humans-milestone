# humans-milestone
A Survival Horror game developed using the Godot Engine 3.2.3 and C#.
<br/><br/>

The game is about humans being used as samples in an experiment made by a more advanced and unknown civilization. They want to find out how intelligent humans are, exposing humans to a very stressful experiment where the sample must solve puzzles while avoiding getting caught by a weird creature. Some data is collected and analyzed by this unknown civilization to come to a conclusion about how intelligent that sample is.

Version 1.1 changes:
